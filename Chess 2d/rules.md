# Chess 2D - Guide

## Introduction
Chess is a strategic board game played between two players. The game is played on an 8x8 grid where each player commands an army of 16 pieces. The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent’s king.

## Game Setup
- The game starts with each player having 16 pieces: 1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, 2 Bishops, and 8 Pawns.
- White pieces start at ranks 1 and 2, while Black pieces start at ranks 7 and 8.
- The board should be positioned so that each player has a light-colored square on their right-hand side.
- White moves first, and players alternate turns.

## Piece Movement
- **Pawn**: Moves forward one square (two on its first move) and captures diagonally.
- **Rook**: Moves horizontally or vertically any number of squares.
- **Knight**: Moves in an L-shape (two squares in one direction, then one perpendicular).
- **Bishop**: Moves diagonally any number of squares.
- **Queen**: Moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally any number of squares.
- **King**: Moves one square in any direction.

## Special Moves
- **Castling**: The king moves two squares towards a rook, and the rook jumps to the other side. Conditions:
  - Neither the king nor the rook involved must have moved before.
  - No pieces can be between them.
  - The king may not move through or into check.
- **En Passant**: A special pawn capture when an opponent’s pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside your pawn.
- **Pawn Promotion**: When a pawn reaches the opponent’s last rank, it must be promoted to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight (usually a Queen).

## Winning & Draw Conditions
- **Checkmate**: The game ends when a player’s king is in check and has no legal move to escape.
- **Stalemate**: The game is a draw if a player has no legal moves but is not in check.
- **Threefold Repetition**: The game is a draw if the same position occurs three times.
- **50-Move Rule**: If no pawn moves or captures have occurred in 50 consecutive moves, the game is drawn.
- **Insufficient Material**: If neither player has enough material to checkmate (e.g., King vs. King, King & Bishop vs. King), the game is drawn.

## Scoring System
While classical chess does not use a point system, a general way to evaluate material advantage is:
- Pawn = 1 point
- Knight = 3 points
- Bishop = 3 points
- Rook = 5 points
- Queen = 9 points
- King = Infinite (since losing it means losing the game)

## Notation System
Chess uses algebraic notation to record moves. Examples:
- `e4` – Pawn moves to e4.
- `Nf3` – Knight moves to f3.
- `0-0` – Kingside castling.
- `0-0-0` – Queenside castling.
- `exd5` – Pawn captures on d5.
- `Qxe5+` – Queen captures on e5 with check.

## Strategy Tips
- Control the center with pawns and pieces.
- Develop knights and bishops before moving the queen.
- Keep the king safe by castling early.
- Avoid unnecessary pawn moves in the opening.
- Look for tactics like pins, forks, and skewers.
- Always consider your opponent’s possible threats.

## Conclusion
Chess is a game of deep strategy and tactics. Mastering the rules and practicing different strategies will help players improve. Enjoy the game and strive for continuous learning!
